      <h1>About Tagelharpa Designer</h1>
      <p>
        This tool is designed to help calculate and visualize various design aspects of the Tagelharpa. It is an attempt to try and create a level of standardisation to help <b>amatuer</b> builders avoid 
        analysis paralysis. When I started looking at how to build a bowed lyre, I was overwhelmed by how much conflicting information was available about every little aspect.
        With no disrespect to all the DIY builers out there, this is predominantly being caused by a lack of knowledge, and a necessity to to have to "wing it" until a nice sound is found then that builder
        will continue to build using those dimensions.

        I have looked over too mamny photos of instruments that I have heard and subjectively think sound the nicest, scaled dimensions from the photos, found the ratios and low-and-behold, there is 
        a pattern. These patterns are what I have used in my calculator.

    <br><br>
    <b>NOTE:</b> These dimensions are by no means perfect. A skilled luthier will most likely be able to blow away anything made with this calculator (and I am certain to get some complaints that I am doing something wrong from them on this haha - I know it's not perfect!). However, it does
    provide a strong starting point and will produce a reasonable sounding instrument. It should drastically reduce the effort that is required to start building from scratch. If it helps at least one other person, I will be happy!
    <br><br>
    Thank you, and enjoy!

        <h2>Critical Dimensions for the Talharpa Instrument</h2>

<p>
  The Talharpa’s design is based on a set of proportional relationships that scale the instrument’s dimensions according to the chosen scale length and number of strings.
  Below is an explanation of each critical dimension using traditional mathematical formulas.
</p>

<h3>A. String Scale (Peg-to-Bridge Distance)</h3>
<p>
  The distance from the nut (or peg) to the bridge is defined as the string scale.
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">A = scaleMm</span>, where 
  <span class="math-formula">scaleMm = scaleCm × 10</span>.
</p>

<h3>B. Overall Instrument Length</h3>
<p>
  The overall length is calculated piecewise from the scale length (in cm):
  <br>
  For <em>scaleCm ≤ 40</em>: 
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">B = scaleCm × 1.66 × 10</span>
  <br>
  For <em>scaleCm ≥ 56</em>: 
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">B = scaleCm × 1.43 × 10</span>
  <br>
  For <em>40 &lt; scaleCm &lt; 56</em>, let 
  <span class="math-formula">f = (scaleCm – 40) / 16</span>, then:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">B = scaleCm × [1.66 – 0.23 × f] × 10</span>
</p>

<h3>C. Window Length</h3>
<p>
  The window (soundboard opening) is designed for a full octave:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">C = 0.5 × scaleMm + 20</span>
</p>

<h3>D. Window Width</h3>
<p>
  The window width is based on the number of strings and a fixed peg spacing:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">D = pegSpacing × numStrings</span>,
  where <span class="math-formula">pegSpacing = 36</span> mm.
</p>

<h3>E. Peg Spacing</h3>
<p>
  The spacing between pegs is fixed:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">E = 36&nbsp;mm</span>
</p>

<h3>F. Headstock Width</h3>
<p>
  The headstock width is determined by the window width plus an additional 50 mm:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">F = D + 50</span>
</p>

<h3>G. Bridge Width</h3>
<p>
  The bridge width is defined piecewise:
  <br>
  If <em>scaleCm ≤ 30</em>: <span class="math-formula">G = 60&nbsp;mm</span>;
  <br>
  If <em>scaleCm ≥ 56</em>: <span class="math-formula">G = 70&nbsp;mm</span>;
  <br>
  For <em>30 &lt; scaleCm &lt; 56</em>, let 
  <span class="math-formula">f = (scaleCm – 30) / 26</span>, then:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">G = 60 + 10 × f</span>
</p>

<h3>H. Bridge Spacing</h3>
<p>
  After subtracting 12 mm from each side of the bridge width, the usable span is:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">Usable Span = G – 24</span>
  <br>
  If more than one string is used, the gap between string centers is:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">H = Usable Span / (numStrings – 1)</span>
</p>

<h3>I. Body Minimum Width</h3>
<p>
  The body’s minimum width is determined from empirical data. For example:
  <br>
  - For <em>scaleCm ≤ 32</em>: <span class="math-formula">I = 160&nbsp;mm</span>
  <br>
  - For <em>32 &lt; scaleCm ≤ 37</em>: I is interpolated from 160 to 190 mm.
  <br>
  - For <em>37 &lt; scaleCm &lt; 56</em>: I is interpolated from 190 to 210 mm.
  <br>
  - For <em>scaleCm ≥ 56</em>: <span class="math-formula">I = 210&nbsp;mm</span>
</p>

<h3>J. Body Minimum Depth</h3>
<p>
  The body’s depth is given by:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">J = clamp(scaleMm × 0.12, 45, 70)</span>,
  meaning the calculated value is limited between 45 mm and 70 mm.
</p>

<h3>K. Tail Top Width</h3>
<p>
  The tailpiece’s top width is defined as:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">K = H × numStrings</span>
  <br>
  (where H is the gap between strings.)
</p>

<h3>L. Tail Bottom Width</h3>
<p>
  The tailpiece’s bottom width is a fraction of the top width:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">L = K × 0.7</span>
</p>

<h3>M. Tail Length</h3>
<p>
  The tailpiece length is given by:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">M = 0.4 × (B – scaleMm)</span>,
  where B is the overall instrument length.
</p>

<h3>N. Headstock Thickness</h3>
<p>
  The headstock thickness is fixed:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">N = 35&nbsp;mm</span>
</p>

<h3>O. Soundhole Centre</h3>
<p>
  The centre of the soundhole is calculated by:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">
    O = ((scaleMm – C – (cutOutTop/2)) / 1.85) + C + cutOutTop
  </span>
  <br>
  where <span class="math-formula">C = windowLength</span> and <span class="math-formula">cutOutTop</span> is the vertical offset for the window.
</p>

<h3>P. Neck Start</h3>
<p>
  The neck start position is determined by the distance between the bottom of the window and the top of the soundhole. With:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">bottomOfWindow = windowLength + cutOutTop</span>
  <br>
  the neck start is:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">P = ((O – bottomOfWindow) / 3) + bottomOfWindow</span>
  <br>
  This sets the vertical point where the neck begins.
</p>

<h3>Q. Neck Thickness</h3>
<p>
  Neck thickness is set based on scale; for instance:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">
    Q = { 35 mm if scaleMm > 450; otherwise 25 mm }
  </span>
  <br>
  This parameter accounts for the need for a thicker neck in larger instruments.
</p>

<h3>R. Width at Neck Level</h3>
<p>
  The width of the instrument at the neck level is found by linear interpolation between the top width and the bottom width of the instrument. Let:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">r = P / B</span>, where P is the Neck Start and B is the Overall Length.
  <br>
  Then the width at the neck is:
  <br>
  <span class="math-formula">
    Width<sub>neck</sub> = F + (I – F) × r
  </span>
  <br>
  Here, <span class="math-formula">F</span> is the headstock width (top width) and <span class="math-formula">I</span> is the body minimum width.
</p>

            Measurements derived from photographs using a conversion factor from a known dimension allowed me to extract physical dimensions such as width and depth.

            <strong>Traditional Instrument Construction Practices:</strong>
            Insights from maker documentation, historical photographs, and contemporary practices iallowed me to make estimates for the soundboard thickness (averaging around 6–7 mm) and overall body depth (roughly 10–12% of the instrument's overall length, such as 50–70 mm for certain sizes).

          <li>
            <strong>Bridge Height Analysis:</strong>
            Comparative research on instruments like violins and historical tagelharpa examples indicated that violins have an overall bridge height around 33 mm, tagelharpa bridges are typically quite varied but I think this is more down to design by experimentation than for any reason. I have recommended 30-35mm.
